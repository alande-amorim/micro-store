## Known issues
 - no tests
 - there are a few untreated RPC timeouts between services
 - there is no Shopify GraphQL create order mutation
 - the staging Shopify store currently does not allow for order checkout

 - forgot to format a nice error response on webhook fail (it still responds 500 so Shopify can monitor)
